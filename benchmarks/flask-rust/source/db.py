In the code provided, we have two functions related to reading and writing grocery items to a JSON file.

The `read_items` function reads the grocery items from the `storage/items.json` file and returns them as a list. It uses the `json.load` function to parse the JSON data from the file.

The `write_items` function takes a list of grocery items as input and writes them to the `storage/items.json` file. It uses the `json.dump` function to serialize the grocery items into JSON format and write them to the file.

Please note that the file paths in the code are relative to the root of the codebase.

It's important to ensure that the `storage/items.json` file exists and has the appropriate permissions before running these functions. Exceptions, such as `FileNotFoundError` or `PermissionError`, may be raised if there are issues with file access.

Make sure to update the file paths or handle errors as necessary for your specific use case.
